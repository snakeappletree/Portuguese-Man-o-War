Large Sequence K-mer Counting

This tool is used to count k-mers in large sequences of DNA similar to the well-known program jellyfish (seen in Lab 2, Part 1).
The tool operates using the external library mmh3 for efficient hashing for k-mer storage.
The tool contains the following submethods:
 - Count: Counts all k-mers in the sequence
 - Histo: Computes a histogram of k-mer occurences
 - Dump: Outputs all k-mer counts
 - Query: Queries the counts for a specific k-mer
To run the tool:
